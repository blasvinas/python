# Python Notes
This file has some basic notes about how to use Python

[Variables](#variables)
[Numbers](#numbers)
[Strings](#strings)

# Variables
In python variable a just references to an object in memory.  For example:

 x = 7

 y = x


The first line creates a integer object in memory and then makes x refers to it.  The second line makes y refers to the same object.

# Numbers
* Booleans
* Intergers
* Floats

## Booleans
The boolean values are True and False. Nonzero numbers are considered True, zero-value are considered False.

## Integers
You can start an interger with 0b for binary, 0o for octal, and 0x for hexadecimal.

You can use underscores to improve readability.  For example 1_000_000  is the same than 1000000

### Operators

| Operator | Description | Example | Result |
|:-------- | :---------- | :------ | :----- |
| +        | Addition    | 5 + 8   | 13     |

# Strings
In python you can use single or double quotes for your string.  For example:

* 'This is a sample string'
* "This is a sample string"
