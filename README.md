# Python Notes
This file has some basic notes about how to use Python

* [Variables](#variables)
* [Numbers](#numbers)
* [Strings](#strings)

# Variables
In python variable a just references to an object in memory.  For example:

 x = 7

 y = x


The first line creates a integer object in memory and then makes x refers to it.  The second line makes y refers to the same object.

# Numbers
* Booleans
* Intergers
* Floats

## Booleans
The boolean values are True and False. Nonzero numbers are considered True, zero-value are considered False.

## Integers
You can start an interger with 0b for binary, 0o for octal, and 0x for hexadecimal.

You can use underscores to improve readability.  For example 1_000_000  is the same than 1000000

### Operators

| Operator | Description | Example | Result |
|:-------- | :---------- | :------ | :----- |
| +        | Addition    | 2 + 3   | 5     |
| -        | Substraction    | 20 - 5  | 15     |
| *        | Multiplication    | 9 * 4  | 36     |
| /        | Floating Division    | 10 / 4  | 2.5     |
| //       | Integer Division    | 9 // 4  | 2     |
| %        | Modulus    | 9 % 4  | 1     |
| **       | Exponentiation    | 2 ** 3   | 8     |

# Strings
In python you can use single or double quotes for your string.  For example:

* 'This is a sample string'
* "This is a sample string"
