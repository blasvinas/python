[Variables](#variables)

# Variables
In python variable a just references to an object in memory.  For example:

 x = 7
 y = x


The first line will create a interger object in memory and them make x to refer to it.  The second line make y to refer to the same object.

# Strings
In python you can use single or double quotes for your string.  For example:

* 'This is a sample string'
* "This is a sample string"
